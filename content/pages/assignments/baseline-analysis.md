**Baseline analysis to document existing project status conditions and to identify priority areas for detailed planning.**

Create a 5-page baseline analysis to document existing project status conditions and to identify priority areas for detailed planning. In this first phase, students will form sub-groups to collect and analyze data to better understand existing issues for each project. For example, students may examine the region's food distribution network, local visions and goals for the district among stakeholders, existing activities and plans, and key future opportunities.

This work will include:

1.  reviewing existing data, regulations and studies;
2.  surveying and mapping existing environmental and physical conditions where necessary, to supplement data already collected by the client;
3.  conducting an inventory of existing resources (e.g. properties and businesses); and
4.  conducting demographic and economic analysis to create profiles of an area.

Based on the findings from this preliminary analysis, student teams will work with the client to outline priority issues to address in their projects.
