Students will be expected to complete journal entries each week that respond to homework and material discussed in class. These assignments are geared to explore issues faced by planners during the planning process as well as document student professional growth and experiences working in multi-disciplinary teams. Many of the reflection exercises will focus on the following themes and questions:

*   How are you combining your values, education and actions in complex situations in the professional work of the class?
*   How are you learning from experiences? How are your experiences shaping your view of what it means to be good planner and what you need to be effective as a planner?
*   What are the key issues, opportunities and challenges of your project? How are these similar to and different from other planning problems?
