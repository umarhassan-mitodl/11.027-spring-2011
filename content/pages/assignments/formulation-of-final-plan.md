**Formulation of recommendations and preparation of the final plan.**

In the final phase, students will review the results of their analysis and research, develop initial proposals for key elements of the projects.

If possible, during the end of April or the first week in May, members of the class may travel to New Orleans to review the draft plan with the client/stakeholders. Based on this presentation and client feedback, students will make revisions to the plan and final written report.
